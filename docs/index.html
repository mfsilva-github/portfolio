      <p><strong>Motivation and Challenges</strong></p>
      <p>
        <span>This portfolio serves two purposes:</span><span> to share my knowledge with the IT community and to identify areas for improvement in my end-to-end project development skills.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>With over 27 years of experience across various IT fields,</span><span> from infrastructure support to application development,</span><span> I've encountered a vast and ever-evolving technological landscape.</span><span> Focusing on my current skillset allows for a more targeted approach in this portfolio.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Another hurdle was project confidentiality.</span><span> Having worked for major tech companies for so long,</span><span> contractual restrictions often limit what project details I can disclose.</span><span> This necessitated a fresh start for building my portfolio.</span>
      </p>
      <p><strong>Project Inspiration</strong></p>
      <p>
        <span>Generative AI was a hot topic when I began this project.</span><span> Tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT,</span><span> Google's Gemini (tha revised this text!)</span><span>),</span><span> and Microsoft's Copilot were all over the news,</span><span> highlighting their potential to streamline development pipelines.</span><span> I decided to leverage these tools in this project.</span>
      </p>
      <p><strong>Defining a Fictional Project</strong></p>
      <p>
        <span>Let's establish a hypothetical opportunity scenario that will guide our project requirements:</span>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ACME Corporation:</strong><span> A retail product seller</span></li>
        <li><strong>ABC Company:</strong><span> An IT service provider offering SaaS solutions</span></li>
        <li><strong>ElectricCar:</strong><span> A company selling electric vehicle charging stations</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <span>These companies all require a marketplace platform where users can purchase or subscribe to their products and services.</span><span> These offerings should be customizable,</span><span> with prices dynamically determined based on customization choices.</span><span> Additionally,</span><span> customers need a unified platform to manage their subscriptions,</span><span> track costs,</span><span> and monitor usage (if applicable).</span>
      </p>
      <p><strong>Technology Selection in Real Projects</strong></p>
      <p>
        <span>In real-world projects,</span><span> existing infrastructure and employee skillsets significantly influence technology selection.</span><span> A company heavily invested in on-premise virtual machines and with a team of Java experts might opt to build the solution using these familiar technologies.</span><span> Migrating to new technologies can be a project in itself,</span><span> often referred to as "digital transformation.</span><span>"</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>However,</span><span> cloud adoption is a growing trend as companies seek to modernize their applications and capitalize on digital transformation.</span><span> While aspects like microservices architecture and DevOps processes are crucial for digital transformation journeys,</span><span> such business process changes fall outside the scope of this project.</span>
      </p>
      <p><strong>Focusing on a Fresh Start</strong></p>
      <p>
        <span>To dive straight into the design,</span><span> let's imagine we're part of a brand new IT startup that will build a marketplace solution for these companies.</span><span> This fresh start allows us to focus purely on the project requirements.</span>
