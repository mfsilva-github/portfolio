    <title>Marcelo's Portfolio In-Progess!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>I started this portfolio to either share my knowledge with the community and to identify my weakness and gaps in an end to end project.</p>
    <p>I have been working on IT area for at least 25 years moving from different areas such as infrastructure support and application developmet. During this period several technologies and methods raised and changed making it very hard to list everything I have already worked. So I decided to focusing in the below technologies: </p>
    <ol>
      <li> Cloud </li>
      <li> Microservice </li>
      <li> React Web App </li>
      <li> Golang API and GRCP </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Other challenge I faced was the projects's privacy and exclusivity that I have worked on.  The last 17 years I have been working for Big Tech Companies that has proihibit contractual clauses about sharing information about the company's project.  Giving that, the only way I could create a profile was starting from scratch.</p>
